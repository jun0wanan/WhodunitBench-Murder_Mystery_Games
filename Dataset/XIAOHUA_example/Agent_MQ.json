The first image contains fragmented text referring to \"Net red school flower fall\u201d and \u201cThe Fall of the Net Red School Flower\". There is also a mention of a brick under pressure in a summer sunny note.\n\n2. The second image includes a student ID card for Sunny Summer from the Min Art College, photography department. There's also information about phone call records from March 28, 2016, at 13:00, and a mention of a diary and clothes fibers.\n\n3. The third image shows a high school graduation photo including seniors Qiao and Xia Qingtan. There's also a reference to red chicken sticks and a series of messages about someone being fooled, emails returned by magazines, and an email submission to Boss Zhang.\n\n4. The fourth image reveals a bank transfer record to Ms. Xia's card ending in 6, receiving 200,000 yuan from a card ending in 8688 on June 1, 2013. There's also a text message about giving one million and a discussion of a Gull School sister space.\n\n5. The fifth image discusses an event room 601 with a printer and A4 paper, SMS records inside a phone, a registration form for a big animation uniform club for a female, and clothes fibers on the window frame of the 601 Activity Room. There's also a mention of a candid photo of Mr. Bai meeting with Xia Qingtian.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these texts seem to provide direct answers to the multi-step multimodal questions listed, which seek specific information regarding the death and medical condition of Sunny Summer, as well as interactions and events involving her and other characters. It appears we need more context or additional data to accurately answer those questions. If there are more images or text that you believe might contain this specific information, please provide them, and I can assist further.", "\u9e25\u5b66\u59b9": "Given the complexity of this Murder Mystery game and the extensive amount of information and clues provided, it seems like you're deeply involved in solving a narrative-driven puzzle. Since I can't view the images directly, I will rely on the descriptions and narrative information you provided to piece together the solution.\n\nLet's consider the key pieces of information you've shared from the game:\n\n1. \u590f\u6674\u5929's (Sunny Day's) cause of death is unclear, but there's mention of poison, suggesting foul play over suicide.\n2. \u590f\u6674\u5929 had heart issues, which is a crucial piece of her health background.\n3. \u767d\u8001\u5e08 (Mr. Bai) had a past love interest in M\u5927's school beauty who tragically passed away years ago, which might affect his current relationships.\n4. \u9e25\u5b66\u59b9 (Gull School Sister) is embroiled in a complex web of relationships, with emotional turmoil caused by the overlapping connections involving her foster father, Mr. Bai, and Sunny Day.\n5. \u4f55\u75f4\u60c5 (He Chiqing) and Sunny Day's relationship encountered issues due to accusations of plagiarism, potentially giving him a motive for murder.\n\nWith this context, let's address the multiple-choice questions you've posed:\n\n\u591a\u6b65\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\n1. Without autopsy reports, I can't confirm, but based on the clues, it might not be a simple suicide.\n2. The main symptom that \u590f\u6674\u5929 had, based on her condition, was likely related to her heart.\n3. Given her heart condition, she would likely carry medication related to that, possibly emergency angina pills.\n4. If \u767d\u8001\u5e08 missed an appointment, it could have been deliberate or due to an unforeseen event.\n5. If \u767d\u8001\u5e08 made multiple appointments, it might suggest he was creating an alibi or trying to manipulate the situation.\n6. \u590f\u6674\u5929 wanted to scare someone; this could be tied to the murder if the intent was misinterpreted or led to an altercation.\n7. An unusual substance on a juice could indicate tampering and suggest how the poison was administered.\n8. The pattern of school beauties dying could indicate a serial situation or a recurring issue at the school.\n9. The dates mentioned in diaries are often significant and might correspond with key events.\n10. Comparisons made by \u767d\u8001\u5e08 on social media could hint at his emotional state and relationships with different characters.\n\nTo piece together the answers, I need to construct a narrative based on the motives, opportunities, and means of each character. However, without direct access to the clues and reports, I can't accurately provide the specific answers to your multiple-choice questions. You'll need to match each clue to the relevant question, considering the personal connections, timelines, and the psychological and emotional states of the characters involved. Always look for the means, motive, and opportunity in each piece of evidence. Good luck with your investigation!", "\u4e54\u5b66\u957f": ""}
